Willems Soft Games Source Code
------------------------------

These are the source codes of the games i created over the years for various (linux) handhelds _[this repo contains solely source code of Sokoban - szymor]_. I released this source code since i will not port anything anymore to another system. The source code and directory structure is pretty messy, but i was in no mood to clean everything up. The source code itselve doesn't contain any comments for the most part and if it does it's probably in dutch. Some source code was build on a windows system, others on a linux system but you can easily make it work on any system. I will not provide any help on how to compile anything, it's basically just SDL, SDL_MIXER, SDL_GFX that was used most of the time so if you know those, you should be able to get it working eventually.

Mostly of the time i used code::blocks to create the source, but i did not always use it to compile to the source code, some sources could contain makefiles some don't. All graphics were made using paint shop pro 7, so the *.psp files, which contain my original graphics to edit, are to be opened with it. Some sound was generated using sfxr, others found on the internet. Some music was found on the internet, others where made by donskeeto. Some games contain the credits inside the game itselve, others only in the readme from the releases. Those readme's are not included in these zips, you can view those on my website per game in the my software section. The game's descriptions on my website are basically the readme's contained in the binary releases.

things that you can do:

- Port to android, ik know this works because i ported 2 games myselve to android but never released them. everything you need about porting sdl sources to android can be found here: http://www.anddev.org/code-snippets-for-android-f33/sdl-port-for-android-sdk-ndk-1-6-t9218.html
- Port to Opendingux, none of my releases work on opendingux because i didn't use shared libraries
- Port older games, i never ported to any of the newer systems. This will be mostly starting from the gp2x source code to for example, caanoo, opendingux, pandora or any other system you'd like

You can use this source code to port it to other systems on the following conditions:
- No money under any circumstances will be asked for the either the source code, binary versions weither they are modified or not. 
- Splashscreens if availible in a game will not be changed ! you may however add new screens with your information if you made a port to some system.
- All releases you do must contain information about the origins of the sources, basically you mention the source code was made by me Willems Davy - Willems soft - Http://www.willemssoft.be
- I'd like to be notified if you made a port to a certain system, if you provide me a link to your website i'll add a link to it on my website.
- The code is provided as is, i will not provide any kind of help about compiling the code.
